This project was created for the Computer Programming 11 Project Two

The popularity of gardening has grown profusely during this pandemic.
Hence, the ability to grow fruits and vegetables has become a hot commodity.
This tool intends to provide the user with help in their gardening endeavours.
One can create a new plant to grow by simply writing the name, grow date, harvest date, and notes on a plant
A user can also load from file, and save their creations easily.
In addition, the "quick create" plants button stores the recommended dates for growing, and harvesting your plants â€” as
recommended by the West Coast Seeds' planting guide for the Lower Mainland.
Another interesting part of this GUI, is that it gives the user the ability to remove a plant permanently, or simply delete the plant from
either the grow, or harvest list.
For example, if one had grown a plant already, they could decide to delete the plant from the grow list, hence,
the user would only be left with the plant in the harvest list.
The user also has the ability to quickly view alerts, in which store either the grow, or harvest dates.

In the future, an improvement could be in characterizing the plants based on the date from today.
This was something that I pursued, but due to time constraints, decided to leave it out of this version.

As for the programming,
I have used Junit 4.12 because the Junit 5.0 Snapshot did not work for some reason.
I suspect it might be the fact that I am using an earlier version of Java JDK.
You may also need to change the path for the files. As I created different folders for plant possibilities, and actual plants grown.
    For example,
    Currently, the file path for some files are listed as:
    C:\\Users\\zheng\\IdeaProjects\\ProjectTwo\\Plants\\, you will probably need to change this to fit where you download this project.
One part that took me a long time to develop, was the video button, I invested a few weeks on how to fully develop a
button that would show a different stage. I made a different project to test, ran different methods, and finally got it to work.
That feeling of accomplishing something that challenges me to adapt to failures, mistakes, and difficulties is what I
love about programming.

I hope you enjoy this application. This course was great, I want to thank Mr. Zaremba for teaching this course, I learned a lot that I will definitely use going forward.
